# **Histopathologic Cancer Detection - Kaggle Mini-Project**

## **1. Problem Description**
In this project, we aim to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. This is a binary image classification problem, where each image is labeled as either containing metastatic tissue (1) or not (0).

The dataset is derived from the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset and consists of RGB images of size 96x96 pixels. The task is to predict the probability that the central 32x32 region of each image contains tumor tissue.

## **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualize random samples from the dataset.
- Analyze the distribution of labels to check for class imbalance.
- Identify any potential data quality issues.

## **3. Data Preprocessing**
- Resize images if needed.
- Normalize pixel values to improve model performance.
- Apply data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping) to enhance generalization.

## **4. Model Architecture**
We will experiment with different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including:
- Basic CNN with Conv2D, ReLU activation, MaxPooling, and Dense layers.
- Advanced architectures with dropout and batch normalization to prevent overfitting.
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG for performance comparison.

## **5. Model Training and Evaluation**
- Compile the model using `binary_crossentropy` as the loss function and `Adam` as the optimizer.
- Train the model and evaluate performance using validation accuracy and AUC.
- Implement early stopping to avoid overfitting.

## **6. Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and optimizer settings.
- Compare model performance across different configurations.

## **7. Results and Analysis**
- Present results with confusion matrix, ROC curve, and performance metrics.
- Discuss which techniques improved model performance and why.
- Identify areas for further improvement.

## **8. Conclusion**
Summarize key findings, lessons learned, and potential future work to enhance model performance.
